•	The .py file itself is actually not executable (lots of text and examples).<br>
It has 9 individual questions focused on drawing<br>
3 types of shape styles in python.<br>
<br>
•	Each question has at least 2 examples,<br>
with the answer clearly displayed below.<br>
<br>
•	If you are serious about improving your python skills, I would recommend<br>
creating a new folder called "text_shapes" in your python learning<br>
directory and saving each function individually, something<br>
similar to - "square.py", "empty-square.py", "corner-squares.py"<br>
ect, then adding comments to concepts you can't<br>
yet quite understand. +<br>
