The .py file itself is actually not executable. (Lots of text and kind of messy).
It has 9 individual questions focused on drawing
3 types of shape styles in python.

Each question has at least 2 examples,
with the answer clearly displayed below.

If you are serious about improving your python skills, I would recommend
creating a new folder called "text_shapes" in your python learning
directory and saving each function individually, something
similar to - "square.py", "empty-square.py", "corner-squares.py"
ect, then adding comments to concepts you can't
yet quite understand. +

Question are from We Heart Swift.
